time taken to build this page : 1.5 hours [along with media queries, active states styling]

### The challenge

- styling the landing page
- responsive landing page depending on various device's screen size
- implement hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

- writing css code section wise
- once whole page is built focus on active states like hover, focus etc..
- after active states , focus on media queries

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS flexbox
- made responsive with media queries

### What I learned

- positioning
- flexbox
- media queries
- using css variables
- using google fonts
- ```html
  <select id="example-select">
    <option value="" selected disabled>Select an option</option>
    <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
    <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
    <option value="option3">Option 3</option>
  </select>

  /*The value="" for the default option ensures that it doesn't have a
  meaningful value. The selected attribute makes it the default option when the
  dropdown is first loaded. The disabled attribute ensures that this option
  cannot be selected by the user after the dropdown is expanded, forcing them to
  choose a valid option.*/
  ```
